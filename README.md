## Overview
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to an Amazon Fashion dataset (~13,000 original rows, cleaned to 1,787 usable rows).  
The goal is to uncover key trends in product brands, pricing, categories, and ratings to provide actionable insights for both Amazon fashion sellers and buyers.

---

## Key Findings
- **Ratings Per Brand** ‚Äì Six of the ten highest-rated brands are bag companies, confirming that bags consistently earn stronger customer reviews than other fashion products.  
- **Product Pricing** ‚Äì The majority of products are priced below the high-end mark; only one product reaches \$26,000, making it a clear outlier.  
- **Rating Distribution** ‚Äì Most fashion products receive high ratings, between 4.0 and 5.0 stars.  
- **Price vs Rating** ‚Äì Correlation ‚âà 0.03, indicating no meaningful relationship between price and customer rating.

---

## Business Strategies for Amazon Fashion Sellers
- **Prioritize Bag-Related Products** ‚Äì Bag companies should treat Amazon as a primary sales channel, given their consistently strong customer reviews and growing popularity.  
- **Focus on the *Most-Loved Fashion* Category** ‚Äì This category holds the highest average customer rating on Amazon and offers strong growth potential.  
- **Maintain Competitive, Mid-Range Pricing** ‚Äì Since non-luxury products dominate and higher prices do not drive higher ratings, competitive pricing is key.  
- **Protect Customer Ratings** ‚Äì Fashion sellers should maintain consistently high ratings in a marketplace already saturated with well-rated competitors.
